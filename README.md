App to control Arduino over wifi (turn on/off lights and other) and sketch for Arduino IDE

You can control Arduino with any web browser and comunicate with it with GET method example: http://IPADDRESS/led to turn on/off a led!
This simple app for iPhone do the same thing when you tap the button!
You MUST have a WiFi Shield for Arduino to use this sketch 
but you can also have a Eterneth shield and edit this sketch to make it working with that shield.
